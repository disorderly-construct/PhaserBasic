# PhaserBasic

PhaserBasic is a template for implementing basic movement and collision mechanics for 2D 16x16px game in Phaser 3 using ES5 syntax without import statements.

## Description

This template provides a starting point for creating games with basic player movement and collision functionality. The project is set up with multiple files, including Player.js, MainScene.js, main.js, and index.html, which need to be linked and assets need to be connected before use.

## Features

- Basic player movement and collision mechanics.
- Player controls implemented in Player.js and connected to MainScene.js, main.js, and index.html.
- Supports v2 controls that allow for multiple key presses but only register the last key pressed.
- Uses arcade physics for simplicity.
- Updated movement sprites and animations to correctly correlate with button press.
